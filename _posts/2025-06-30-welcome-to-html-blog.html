<p>Welcome to my first blog post using HTML instead of Markdown in Jekyll!</p>

<h2>Why HTML Instead of Markdown?</h2>

<p>While Markdown is great for simple content, HTML gives us more control over the structure and presentation of our content. This is especially useful for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex layouts</li>
  <li>Custom styling within content</li>
  <li>Interactive elements</li>
  <li>Special formatting needs</li>
</ul>

<p>Using HTML with Jekyll's templating system (Liquid) gives us the best of both worlds: the simplicity of a static site generator with the flexibility of hand-coded HTML.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>In the coming posts, I'll explore more advanced Jekyll features and how to implement them using HTML instead of Markdown.</p>
